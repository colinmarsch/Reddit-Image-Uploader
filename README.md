# Reddit Image Uploader
Reddit Image Uploader is a Google Chrome browser extension that allows for the direct upload of images and gifs found on the internet to Reddit. Eliminating the hassle of downloading the image or copying the image's url.
## How It Works
You simply right click on the image/gif that you want to upload and select the "Upload This Image/Gif to Reddit" option. The image is then uploaded to Imgur or Gfycat if it is a gif or video file. By default a direct link to the image on Imgur and the Reddit submit page for that image will open in separate tabs. You can turn off the automatic opening of the image of Imgur in the options page for the extension. Unfortunately, currently the Gfycat page must be opened for the extension to properly retrieve the url of uploaded gif/video.
## TODO
* Add support for users to host the images on their own Imgur account's
